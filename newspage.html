                <p>Rahul Dravid on Virat Kohli: We are happy with his performance â€¢ Getty Images</p>
                <br />
            </div>
            <br />
<DIV id="newsbold">
            <p>Hear it loud and clear. Rahul Dravid is not concerned over Virat Kohli's form and while people on the
                outside may be "a bit obsessed with his statistics and numbers", the people on the inside know their
                former captain is worth much more than the fifties and hundreds he can score.
                <br />
                <br />
                "He played very well in the last match [against Hong Kong], and we are happy with his performance,"
                Dravid said. "He is also coming back after a gap of almost a month. It's nice to the see that he has
                come back fresh and that he is looking forward to playing every game. Not that he wasn't looking forward
                to playing every game earlier."
            </p>
            In a chat with Star Sports prior to the Asia Cup, Kohli had touched upon the reasons for his lack of runs.
            He was point blank when he said, he had been "trying to fake intensity a bit" in his determination to keep
            playing. At the time, Kohli also opened up about how the demands of his schedule had affected his love for
            training, something that "disturbed" him and made him realise he needed "to step away" for some time.
            <br />
            <br />
            It appears to have worked. India captain Rohit Sharma saw a freshness to Kohli when the team first got
            together for this tournament in the UAE and Dravid agreed with that assessment.
            <br />
            <br />
            "Sometimes with Virat, he is just one of those guys who is always on," Dravid said. "It's not that earlier
            he was not. It's nice, I'm glad he has had that opportunity to take a break, come back refreshed and
            relaxed. He's got a chance to be out in the middle, spend some time in the middle. Hopefully from here he
            can kick on have a really good tournament."
